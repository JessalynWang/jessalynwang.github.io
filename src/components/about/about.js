              I am an SDE II at Amazon based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
              I graduated in 2023 from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Computer Science. 
              In my spare time I love to draw, read, and travel!

              <br/><br/>

              My areas of interest broadly include <b>safety, sustainability, privacy, and HCI</b>.
              From a technical standpoint I am currently focused on <b>increasing developer productivity</b> by enabling code share and cross-platform development using Kotlin Multiplatform.

              <br/><br/>
              At Amazon I am with the Amazon Delivery organization and have domain expertise in last mile logistics.

              Particularly, I have been deeply involved in technology for <b>safety and contingency response management </b>
              as well as <b>large scale anomaly detection and resolution</b>.
